## üåê Introduction
Hy-GeneNet is a novel hybrid ensemble model designed for the accurate and interpretable classification of DNA gene types. The rapid growth of genomic data necessitates robust tools for analysis, and Hy-GeneNet addresses this by synergistically combining a traditional N-gram model with a modern attention-based deep learning architecture. This fusion allows the model to capture both local statistical patterns and long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

This repository provides all the necessary code to replicate our experiments, train the models on your own data, and explore the model's predictions using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Hybrid Ensemble Approach:** Fuses a TF-IDF N-gram model (with Random Forest) and an Attention-based Bidirectional LSTM for enhanced accuracy.
- **High Performance:** Achieves **98.26% accuracy** and a perfect **1.00 ROC AUC** score on our test dataset.
- **Interpretable by Design:** Includes scripts for XAI analysis using SHAP (for the N-gram model) and Attention Visualization (for the LSTM), ensuring that the model's decisions are transparent and biologically plausible.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Provides a complete workflow from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and interpretation.


## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture
Hy-GeneNet leverages a soft-voting ensemble strategy, averaging the prediction probabilities of two powerful base models:
1.  **N-gram + Random Forest:** Captures local sequence motifs and statistical features using 3-gram to 6-gram representations.
2.  **Attention-based Bi-LSTM:** Learns complex, long-range dependencies in the sequence data using a multi-head attention mechanism.

The final architecture is illustrated below:
